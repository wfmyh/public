      &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="https://d1v1e13ebw3o15.cloudfront.net/data/80029/pool_and_spa_logo/..jpg"&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	Advantech, a global embedded computing leader, has released a pair of SQFlash PCIe Gen.4 SSD solutions: the SQF 930 and SQF ER-1.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Advantech SQF 930 and ER-1 series are designed with PCIe Gen. 4 specifications, delivering double data streaming performance when compared with Gen. 3 solutions. In addition, these solutions are also available in M.2 2280 and U.2 (SFF-8639) sizes to accommodate diverse requirements. In order to fulfil various industrial applications, SQFlash provides different types of general, read-intensive and mixed-use options that enable edge storage devices to keep up with multiple, diverse real-time streaming data sources. In addition, the SQF 930 and ER-1 series support three Drive Writes per Day (DWPD) and one DWPD level to meet different industrial requirements. These also support wide temperature capabilities (-40 – 85°C) for mission-critical applications. The Advantech ER-1 series is built with low power consumption credentials that meet modern ESG high-power and low-carbon expectations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The series adopts thermal glue with mechanical flexibility to avoid the risk of physical damage to SSD components during sudden temperature changes. The combination of thermal throttling design and real-time I/O adjustment is designed to balance temperature and performance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The adoption of IoT has led to rising inter-connectivity and increased security concerns. Accordingly, the series meets these challenges by protecting data stored on the SQFlash SSD. This is achieved by providing support for real-time monitoring and using a complete security solution at the SSD firmware level.

      <title>The use of Nichicon SLB rechargeable batteries in IoT applications</title>
      &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="https://d1v1e13ebw3o15.cloudfront.net/data/80029/pool_and_spa_logo/..jpg"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Internet of Things, i.e. IoT technologies, have been with us for years. Although many beneficiaries of these devices may not realise it, they owe much convenience to small, energy-efficient devices that perform complex measurements and calculations in our everyday surroundings. They allow to &lt;strong&gt;gather accurate data about traffic, weather, air quality in cities, our health — they improve forwarding of courier shipments, warehouse order collection, road, rail and even air transport — what’s more, they make our homes and workplaces safer&lt;/strong&gt;. And it’s all before we even get to the convenience offered by &lt;em&gt;smart&lt;/em&gt; devices: &lt;strong&gt;activity sensors, household automation, etc&lt;/strong&gt;. At the heart of all these technologies are energy-efficient wireless communication modules, based on BLE or LoRa modules, powered by &lt;strong&gt;miniaturised, yet efficient, energy sources&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, a technological revolution is taking place in the field of mobile power supply. Until recently, the main obstacle on the way to progress was not the capacity of integrated circuits, but techniques for supplying them with sufficient energy. Among the most modern methods of energy storage, those that stand out are the miniature solutions which are used in remote sensors or personal &lt;em&gt;wearable&lt;/em&gt; devices. There are hundreds of products available on the global market dedicated to such applications, but &lt;strong&gt;only a few of them match the performance standard offered by the lithium-ion batteries from &lt;a href="https://www.tme.eu/no/en/linecard/p,nichicon_932/" target="_blank"&gt;Nichicon&lt;/a&gt;, included in the SLB series&lt;/strong&gt;. They are based on Toshiba’s proprietary &lt;strong&gt;SCiB&lt;sup&gt;™&lt;/sup&gt; technology&lt;/strong&gt; — used primarily for high-current energy storage. In a miniaturised form supplied by Nichicon, they maintain their &lt;strong&gt;excellent electrical performance, but are enclosed in packages whose size does not exceed that of a tiny electrolytic capacitor&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Japanese supplier, specialist in the construction of components for power supply and amplification systems, has introduced the SLB series to its range of products to cater for the needs of producers of portable devices, industrial sensors, as well as consumer goods. These batteries allow to maximise the efficiency of energy storage in small systems powered traditionally or with the use of &lt;em&gt;energy harvesting&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Technological advantages of Nichicon SLB rechargeable batteries&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we focus on the possibilities that SLB rechargeable batteries offer, let’s look at their characteristics. In comparison with standard solutions, for example with the average 18650 cell, Nichicon products stand out in virtually every field. They are designed to meet &lt;strong&gt;high demands not only in terms of dimensions, but also in terms of electrical performance and physical endurance&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long cycle life and safety&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SLB cells offer a &lt;strong&gt;service life of 25,000 charge/discharge cycles&lt;/strong&gt;. Thanks to this, they can be used in circuits to which external energy is supplied irregularly, periodically or even sporadically. For example, these may be devices that use photovoltaic panels or miniature wind turbines, or consumer products that are charged only when it is convenient for the user. Recharging the battery repeatedly during the day (e.g. due to cloud cover or changing winds) will not significantly &lt;strong&gt;affect&lt;/strong&gt; the energy storage capabilities of SLB cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charge and discharge current&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current capabilities of Nichicon batteries are noteworthy. Their charge/discharge current reaches the &lt;strong&gt;20C rating&lt;/strong&gt;, i.e. 20 times the battery capacity divided by 1 hour. This means that for the &lt;a href="https://www.tme.eu/no/en/details/slb12400l1511cv/akumulatory/nichicon/" target="_blank"&gt;SLB12400L1511CV&lt;/a&gt; (150mAh) model, the current supplied and consumed can be as much as 150 mA * 20 = 3 A. With such parameters of charging, full charging of the cell &lt;strong&gt;will be achieved after just 3 minutes&lt;/strong&gt;. Conversely, the battery &lt;strong&gt;can deliver high current in a short period of time, e.g. to switch on a light/alarm, send a message using a long range radio module&lt;/strong&gt; etc. In combination with the long cycle life, this opens way to the construction of devices which will be: (a) &lt;strong&gt;charged only periodically&lt;/strong&gt; (during maintenance, when reading the meter value), using the accumulated energy sparingly on a daily basis; (b) or also &lt;strong&gt;charged gradually&lt;/strong&gt;, e.g. with a small solar cell, but under certain conditions &lt;strong&gt;capable of activating not only electronic circuits, but also electromechanical components such as servos, solenoid valves&lt;/strong&gt; etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resistance to environmental conditions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we have already suggested, many of the applications in which the SLB series cells are and will be used involve harsh environmental conditions. This includes r&lt;strong&gt;emote sensors used in agriculture as well as &lt;em&gt;wearable&lt;/em&gt; consumer devices, i.e. body-worn electronics such as medical wristbands, location tags or&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;smart watches&lt;/em&gt;. Therefore, a particularly important characteristic of lithium-ion rechargeable batteries by Nichicon is their thermal tolerance. These products can &lt;strong&gt;operate without any difficulty in temperatures ranging from -30 to 60°C&lt;/strong&gt;. Furthermore, even when these parameters are exceeded, there is a &lt;strong&gt;very low probability of failure, spontaneous ignition or explosion&lt;/strong&gt;. This will be a particularly important feature for manufacturers of consumer appliances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Energy harvesting&lt;/em&gt; – it’s time to fulfil Tesla’s dream&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most popular stories about the beginnings of electronics is Nikola Tesla’s project: a large-scale network that would aim to distribute electricity wirelessly. Although the project never made it outside the demo prototypes’ phase, which we would call &lt;em&gt;proof of concept&lt;/em&gt; today, modern technology to some extent legitimises the Serbian inventor’s concept. Here, in the era of energy-sufficient IoT (&lt;em&gt;Internet of Things&lt;/em&gt;) circuits, the construction of devices powered “out of thin air” no longer seems like a pipe dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technologies grouped under the term &lt;em&gt;energy harvesting&lt;/em&gt; include a range of methods for extracting small amounts of energy from the environment. These include “classic” solutions such as &lt;strong&gt;photovoltaic cells and wind turbines&lt;/strong&gt;, but also less conventional techniques. In addition to movement caused by atmospheric phenomena, energy can actually come from &lt;strong&gt;any flow of gases and liquids, such as in water pipes, sewage pipes, as well as near roads or in air conditioning ducts&lt;/strong&gt;. Piezoelectric materials are also used to aggregate energy, whereby &lt;strong&gt;voltage is generated by varying pressure&lt;/strong&gt; (e.g. on pavements or roads). As IoT technology is developing, we are observing the growing use of &lt;strong&gt;thermoelectric sources based on the Peltier effect, allowing the use of temperature differences (e.g. between the atmosphere and a thermal source, a warm water supply or even the human body&lt;/strong&gt; to generate small electrical currents. These will not provide very much, but sufficient power for e.g. &lt;strong&gt;BLE modules&lt;/strong&gt;. And finally, the method that is closest to Tesla’s idea should be mentioned here: &lt;strong&gt;RF energy harvesting&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;em&gt;RF harvesting&lt;/em&gt; uses ubiquitous radio signals (Wi-Fi, TV and even satellite signals) as its source of power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SLB rechargeable batteries from Nichicon provide performance parameters that are perfectly suited to the needs of devices using the &lt;em&gt;energy harvesting&lt;/em&gt; technology. Since they can be charged with very high, but also very low currents (for &lt;a href="https://www.tme.eu/no/en/details/slb03070lr351bs/akumulatory/nichicon/" target="_blank"&gt;SLB03070LR351BS&lt;/a&gt; model it is 3.5µA), they can be implemented in circuits using the above-mentioned solutions. This means the construction of a completely new type of electronic devices — self-sufficient solutions. As a further consequence, it means &lt;strong&gt;huge savings&lt;/strong&gt; connected with the limited needs for construction of power supply infrastructure and maintenance, as well as &lt;strong&gt;possibility to construct scalable and complex networks both in industry&lt;/strong&gt; (e.g. commerce, warehousing, shipping) and &lt;strong&gt;public space&lt;/strong&gt; (traffic management systems, public transport, meteorological, seismic sensor networks etc.). &lt;em&gt;Beacons&lt;/em&gt; or environmental sensors powered by SLB cells from Nichicon (charged used commonly available energy sources) are &lt;strong&gt;another step towards a computerised, safe and environmentally friendly future&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Australian quantum industry poised to reach $6 billion by 2045</title>
      &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="https://d1v1e13ebw3o15.cloudfront.net/data/80029/pool_and_spa_logo/..jpg"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Quantum technology is forecast to reach $6 billion and generate more than 19,000 jobs in Australia by 2045, according to updated market projections released by CSIRO, Australia’s national science agency. CSIRO’s original &lt;a href="https://www.csiro.au/en/work-with-us/services/consultancy-strategic-advice-services/CSIRO-futures/Future-Industries/Quantum" target="_blank"&gt;Growing Australia’s Quantum Technology Industry Roadmap&lt;/a&gt; has been updated two years on and reflects the growth trajectory of quantum technology across the report’s three key domains of quantum computing, sensing and measurement, and communications. The report provides estimates and refinements of the original modelling and extends the forecast from 2040 to 2045 while affirming the economy results from the earlier report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSIRO Senior Economist Mingji Liu said that the updated figures reflected recent domestic and global developments in quantum technology opportunities. “Our updated modelling reaffirms that quantum technology continues to be a significant opportunity for Australia in the years to come. Although there is still uncertainty as to how quantum technology will be commercialised both around the world and domestically, the start-up funding and investment in quantum is encouraging,” Liu said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="img-responsive" src="https://d2emomln4apc0h.cloudfront.net/assets/490406/web_image_article/CSIRO_Australian_quantum_industry.jpg" style="display: block; margin: auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;h9&gt;Australia has strong research capabilities in quantum hardware development and quantum information science, both of which are critical to the development of the hardware and software stack needed to enable functional quantum computing applications. Image credit: CSIRO&lt;/h9&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The economic modelling forecasts that by 2030, Australia’s quantum technology opportunity in revenue terms could conservatively reach $2.2 billion and could generate 8700 jobs. In five years, this could reach $3.3 billion by 2035, and then reach $4.6 billion by 2040 and could generate 16,100 jobs (the same as original projections in 2020). According to CSIRO Quantum Technologies Director Jim Rabeau, the last 18 months have seen a significant increase in focus to strengthen Australia’s position in the emerging global quantum industry. “CSIRO has launched its Future Science Platform, a number of new companies have been backed or reached key milestones, a tech industry group has been formed and we’re seeing an intensive national focus. The key now will be to sustain and grow over the long term,” Rabeau said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSIRO Chief Executive Larry Marshall said that Australia is at a pivotal stage of growing its quantum industry and is at a tipping point between research and commercial development. “We need to harness our bold vision for what this breakthrough technology could mean for some of our largest industries,” Marshall said.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>AI powers all-in-one miniature spectrometer</title>
      &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="https://d1v1e13ebw3o15.cloudfront.net/data/80029/pool_and_spa_logo/..jpg"&gt; &lt;p&gt;An international research team led by researchers at Aalto University has developed high-sensitivity spectrometers with high wavelength accuracy, high spectral resolution and broad operation bandwidth, using only a single microchip-sized detector. The research for this ultra-miniaturised spectrometer was published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.add8544" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spectrometers are widely used throughout industry and research to detect and analyse light. Spectrometers measure the spectrum of light — its strength at different wavelengths, like the colours in a rainbow — and are useful for identifying and analysing specimens and materials. Integrated on-chip spectrometers can be of benefit to a variety of technologies, including quality inspection platforms, security sensors, biomedical analysers, healthcare systems, environmental monitoring tools and space telescopes. Postdoctoral researcher Hoon Hahn Yoon said that the single-detector spectrometer is an all-in-one device that measures light intensity at each wavelength beyond the visible spectrum. According to Yoon, the device is entirely controllable, with potential for scalability and integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We designed this optoelectronic-lab-on-a-chip with artificial intelligence replacing conventional hardware, such as optical and mechanical components. Therefore, our computational spectrometer does not require separate bulky components or array designs to disperse and filter light. It can achieve high resolution comparable to benchtop systems but in a much smaller package. Integrating it directly into portable devices such as smartphones and drones could advance our daily lives. Imagine that the next generation of our smartphone cameras could be fitted with hyperspectral cameras that outperform colour cameras,” Yoon said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shrinking computational spectrometers is vital for their use in chips and implantable applications. Professor Zhipei Sun, the head of the research team, said that conventional spectrometers are bulky because they need optical and mechanical components, thereby limiting their on-chip applications. “There is an emerging demand in this field to improve the performance and usability of spectrometers. From this point of view, miniaturised spectrometers are very important for future applications to offer high performance and new functions in all fields of science and industry,” Sun said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professor Pertti Hakonen said that with further improvements in resolution and efficiency, the spectrometer could provide a new tool for quantum information processing. “Finland and Aalto have invested in photonics research in recent years. For example, there has been great support from the Academy of Finland’s Centre of Excellence on quantum technology, Flagship on Photonics Research and Innovation, InstituteQ and the Otanano Infrastructure. Our new spectrometer is a clear demonstration of the success of these collaborative efforts,” Hakonen said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to Postdoctoral Researcher Hoon Hahn Yoon and Professors Zhipei Sun and Pertti Hakonen, the key Aalto members linked to the work included Postdoctoral Researchers Henry A Fernandez and Faisal Ahmed, Doctoral Researchers Fedor Nigmatulin, Xiaoqi Cui, Md Gius Uddin and Professor Harri Lipsanen.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>STMicroelectronics IPS1025HF fast-starting high-side power switch</title>
      &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="https://d1v1e13ebw3o15.cloudfront.net/data/80029/pool_and_spa_logo/..jpg"&gt; &lt;p&gt;STMicroelectronics has introduced the IPS1025HF fast-starting high-side power switch for use in safety systems that require minimal power-on delay time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The power switch is designed to respond to turn-on and turn-off signals in less than 60 µs even considering the Vcc power-on and off, enabling protective systems to provide a specified safety-integrity level (SIL). Featuring a wide input-voltage range from 8.65 to 60 V and able to tolerate up to 65 V on the input pin, the devices are designed to withstand harsh industrial operating conditions. Applications include power control for programmable logic controllers (PLCs), vending machines, factory-automation I/O peripherals and computer numerical control (CNC) machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like similar single-channel and dual devices in ST’s intelligent power switch family, the IPS1025HF has two programmable current-limit settings that allow the user to program a higher current limitation value at power switch activation. This enhances flexibility for driving loads such as bulb lamps, motors and capacitive loads that require high initial peak current.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The output stage is an N-channel Power MOSFET with a typical Rds(on) of 12.5 mOhm at ambient temperature, for high energy efficiency and low thermal dissipation. The MOSFET is internally limited at 2.5 A minimum output current and has single-pulse avalanche energy up to 14 J, which boosts reliability for handling inductive loads. There is also an integrated active clamp for fast demagnetisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The switch includes protection against undervoltage, overvoltage, overload, short circuit, ground disconnection and Vcc disconnection. On-chip diagnostics include individual signalling of output overload and junction overtemperature and there is an extra thermal sensor to detect excessive case temperature. The device is designed to meet IEC 61000-4-2 ESD, IEC 61000-4-4 and IEC 61000-4-5 specifications for ESD, fast-transient and surge immunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For fast evaluation, the X-NUCLEO-OUT15A1 expansion board contains an IPS1025HF with associated circuitry ready to connect to STM32 Nucleo development boards. A demonstration firmware pack, STSW-OUT15F4, and industrial-automation system design GUI, STSW-IFAPGUI, are also available, thereby providing an entire industrial-automation environment on the desktop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The power switch is in production now, available in both PowerSSO-24 and QFN48L packages.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Strength in numbers when it comes to inertial sensors</title>
      &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="https://d1v1e13ebw3o15.cloudfront.net/data/80029/pool_and_spa_logo/..jpg"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers working in the field of navigation and supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) have developed a method that allows several low-cost inertial sensors working in combination to replace a single expensive sensor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inertial sensors such as accelerometers and gyroscopes are used nearly everywhere, from smart watches to submarines, drones, spacecraft, vacuum cleaners and even game controllers. The purpose of these sensors is to indicate the position, speed or direction of an object. Their drawback is their lack of precision, at least when it comes to the low-cost versions used in many devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now there may be a way to solve this problem, with researchers from the &lt;a href="https://www.unige.ch/en/" target="_blank"&gt;University of Geneva&lt;/a&gt; reporting that networking several inexpensive sensors is a viable alternative to more powerful sensors. By combining the measurements of several low-cost, individual sensors, the researchers succeeded in obtaining a very precise navigational measurement. Their breakthrough was published in the journal &lt;a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9899741/authors" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is as if we had created a virtual sensor, and it is particularly efficient because it uses all the information provided by the individual sensors,” said Yuming Zhang, a PhD candidate in statistics and lead author of the new study. These virtual sensors not only offer the same performance as actual sensors but are also less expensive and can be more flexibly configured. They could therefore be used in a number of consumer devices without increasing their cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of combining information from different sensors is not new, but until now technical constraints have limited its application. As explained by Zhang, “Sensor measurement errors are very complex to handle individually, and even more so when several sensors are combined.” The team solved the problem using a new signal decomposition approach, which makes it possible to understand and deal with errors that affect measurements and to process them using a novel statistical method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the researchers, the potential applications of the new technique widely range from aerial mapping using drones to autonomous vehicles. In addition, the ability to optimally combine different sensor technologies could help develop a new generation of global positioning systems.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Beyond qubits: unlocking the potential of quantum computing</title>
      &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="https://d1v1e13ebw3o15.cloudfront.net/data/80029/pool_and_spa_logo/..jpg"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Quantum computers are powerful computational devices that rely on quantum mechanics, or the science of how particles like electrons and atoms interact with the world around them. These devices could be used to solve certain kinds of computational problems in a shorter amount of time, with scientists hoping that quantum computing could be the next great advance in computing. However, existing limitations have prevented the technology from hitting its true potential — for these computers to work, the basic unit of information integral to their operation, known as quantum bits (or qubits), needs to be stable and fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Qubits are represented by simple binary quantum states and by various physical implementations. One candidate is a trapped electron that levitates in a vacuum. However, controlling the quantum states, especially the vibrational motions, of trapped electrons can be difficult. In a paper published in &lt;a href="https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.4.033245" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physical Review Research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, researchers identified possible solutions to some of the limitations of qubits for quantum computing. The researchers looked at two different hybrid quantum systems: an electron-superconducting circuit and an electron–ion coupled system. Both systems were able to control the temperature and the movement of the electron.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assistant Professor Alto Osada at the Komaba Institute for Science at the University of Tokyo said that the researchers found a way to cool down and measure the motion of an electron levitated in a vacuum, or a trapped electron, both in the quantum regime. “With the feasibility of quantum-level control of the motion of trapped electrons, the trapped electron becomes more promising and attractive for quantum-technology applications, such as quantum computing,” Osada said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed systems that the researchers focused on included an electron trapped in a vacuum called a Paul trap interacting with superconducting circuits and a trapped ion. Because ions are positively charged and electrons are negatively charged, when they are trapped together, they move toward each other because of a phenomenon called Coulomb attraction. Because the electron has such a light mass, the interactions between the electron and circuit and the electron and the ion were particularly strong. The researchers also found that they could control the temperature of the electron using microwave fields and optical lasers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers also measured the success of their calculations through the phonon mode of the electron. Phonon refers to a unit of energy that characterises a vibration, or in this case, the oscillation of the trapped electron. The desirable result was a single-phonon readout and ground-state cooling (the frozen state of the electron). Researchers were able to accomplish these through their two hybrid systems they analysed. “Highly efficient and high-fidelity quantum operations are available in the trapped-electron system. This novel system manifests itself as a new playground for the development of quantum technologies,” Osada said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that additional experimental research will need to be done to see if their methods can be implemented and applied to quantum computing. They also plan to demonstrate their idea with a proof-of-concept experiment. “We are planning to examine our schemes using electrons trapped in a microwave cavity. Through this research, we will be able to get another step closer toward precise quantum operations and toward the implementation of quantum computation,” Osada said.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>3D printing micrometre-sized parts in the blink of an eye</title>
      &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="https://d1v1e13ebw3o15.cloudfront.net/data/80029/pool_and_spa_logo/..jpg"&gt; &lt;p&gt;A research team from the Queensland University of Technology (QUT), the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), and Heidelberg University have developed a laser printing process that can print micrometre-sized parts precisely and quickly. The international team published its research findings in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41566-022-01081-0" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Photonics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Stereolithography 3D printing is a popular additive manufacturing process for plastics, both for private and industrial applications. In stereolithography, the layers of a 3D object are projected one by one into a container filled with resin. The resin is cured by UV light. However, previous stereolithography methods are slow and have too low a resolution. Light-sheet 3D printing, which is used by the QUT researchers, is a fast and high-resolution alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light-sheet 3D printing, blue light is projected into a container filled with a liquid resin. The blue light pre-activates the resin. In a second stage, a red laser beam provides the additional energy needed to cure the resin. However, 3D printing can only print resins that quickly return from their pre-activated state to their original state. Only then can the next layer be printed. Consequently, the return time dictates the waiting time between two successive layers and thus the printing speed. First author Vincent Hahn from KIT’s Institute of Applied Physics (APH) said that for the resin used by the researchers, the return time was less than 100 microseconds, which allowed for high printing speeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To take advantage of this new resin, the researchers built a special 3D printer, in which blue laser diodes were used to project images into the liquid resin using a high-resolution display with a high frame rate. The red laser was formed into a thin “light sheet” beam and crossed the blue beam vertically in the resin. With this arrangement, the researchers were able to 3D print micrometre-sized parts in a few hundred milliseconds. However, Professor Martin Wegener of APH said that with more sensitive resins, the researchers could even use LEDs instead of lasers in their 3D printer. “Ultimately, we want to print 3D structures that are centimetres in size, while maintaining micrometre resolution and high printing speeds,” Wegener said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The publication was produced within the framework of the joint &lt;a href="https://www.3dmattermadetoorder.kit.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;“3D Matter Made to Order”&lt;/a&gt; Cluster of Excellence of the KIT and Heidelberg University.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Antenova Invicta SRFW082 antenna</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Antenova Ltd, a manufacturer of antennas and RF antenna modules for IoT and M2M, has released Invicta SRFW082, a compact and efficient antenna for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and ZigBee frequencies at 2.4–2.5 GHz. The antenna averages efficiency of 70% across the 2.4 GHz band. Consequently, designs using this antenna can operate better, over longer distances and through walls and obstacles, thus extending the coverage and performance of wireless devices using Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and ZigBee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flexible printed circuit (FPC) antenna is easy to place in a design and connects directly to the PCB via a cable and IPX MHF (UFL) connector. The antenna comes with 100 mm cable as standard and other cable lengths and connector options are available on request. An FPC antenna is different to an SMD antenna in that it operates independent to a ground plane length and no antenna matching is required, so the design cycle for Invicta is simpler and shorter. The FPC antenna also makes for easier manufacturing, as it is fixed in place by a self-adhesive strip and can be curved and inserted into the case of a design. This style of antenna is suitable for small to medium volume manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The antenna is designed primarily for smart battery-powered devices for the home and office, where one single device provides global coverage. Typical applications in the home would be smart meters, home automation, wireless sensor networks and smoke and intruder alarms. It could also be used for remote monitoring in industrial and medical environments. The antenna is designed to perform better than PCB trace antennas, while providing performance and range in return for taking up a relatively small space in a design.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CEA&amp;#39;s RF chip enables IoT connectivity for remote devices</title>
      &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="https://d1v1e13ebw3o15.cloudfront.net/data/80029/pool_and_spa_logo/..jpg"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cea.fr/english/Pages/Welcome.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;CEA&lt;/a&gt;, a French technology-research organisation, and &lt;a href="https://www.astrocast.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Astrocast&lt;/a&gt;, a global satellite Internet of Things network operator, have announced their successful collaboration on a low-cost, bidirectional communication module that enables corporations to communicate with their remote assets in areas not covered by terrestrial networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The module’s L-band chip, based on a new architecture developed by CEA’s Laboratory of Electronics Information Technology (&lt;a href="https://www.leti-cea.com/cea-tech/leti/english/Pages/Welcome.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;CEA-Leti&lt;/a&gt;), is a key hardware component that enables Astrocast customers to benefit from cost-efficient communication with their assets in the field through its network. Completed earlier this year in an expedited project between the research institute and Astrocast, it is embedded in Astrocast’s RF module, Astronode S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chip’s architecture is split over the RF core and digital processing and control units. It is fully optimised to support Astrocast’s dedicated bidirectional ground-to-satellite protocol and provides an optimal trade-off between link budget and low-power and low-cost constraints. The chip also embeds all low-Earth orbit (LEO), satellite-specific features such as satellite detection and robustness to Doppler shift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The miniaturised, surface-mount module communicates with terrestrial devices via Astrocast’s constellation of LEO satellites. Using the L-band spectrum, the network primarily targets maritime, oil and gas, agriculture, land transport and environmental applications in which ubiquitous coverage is required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Terrestrial IoT networks cover only about 15%, which leaves vast remote and rural areas where our global satellite network provides coverage that is crucial for our target markets,” said Laurent Vieira de Mello, COO, Astrocast. “Leveraging its expertise embedded in a preliminary version of the RF chip, CEA-Leti developed its chip and delivered the final prototype to meet our requirements and time-to-market goals. They managed the chip technology transfer to our industrialisation, qualification and production partner.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project’s critical time-to-market window was managed through a flexible collaboration model covering both prototype and industrialisation phases. As explained by Michel Durr, Business Development Manager at CEA-Leti, “An accelerated time-to-market goal drove this project from the outset. We pioneered this RF technology in 2019, and our team customised it for Astrocast up to production in only three years.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CEA-Leti’s industrial tester used for characterisation was key to accelerating from prototype to production, which enabled prototype characterisation in parallel on the tester and in the lab, Durr explained. He said, “This process provided a short-loop debug capability with all skills available at CEA-Leti, and enabled us to deliver fully validated inputs to Astrocast’s industrialisation partner for an easier industrial test-program development.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Light-activated smart plastic a step towards flexible electronics</title>
      &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="https://d1v1e13ebw3o15.cloudfront.net/data/80029/pool_and_spa_logo/..jpg"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at &lt;a href="https://www.utexas.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;The University of Texas at Austin&lt;/a&gt; set out to create a plastic that is hard and rigid in some places and soft and stretchy in others, by using only light and a catalyst to change properties such as hardness and elasticity in molecules of the same type. In doing do, the researchers succeeded in developing a new material that is reportedly 10 times as tough as natural rubber, that could lead to more flexible electronics and robotics. The research findings were published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.add6975" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zachariah Page, a corresponding author on the paper, said that the ability to control crystallisation, and therefore the physical properties of the material, with the application of light, could be transformative for wearable electronics or actuators in soft robotics. “This is the first material of its type,” Page said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists have long sought to mimic the properties of living structures, like skin and muscle, with synthetic materials. In living organisms, structures often combine strength and flexibility with ease. When using a mix of different synthetic materials to mimic these attributes, materials can often fail, come apart and rip at the junctures between different materials. “Oftentimes, when bringing materials together, particularly if they have very different mechanical properties, they want to come apart,” Page said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Page and his team of researchers were able to control and change the structure of a plastic-like material, using light to alter how firm or stretchy the material would be. Chemists started with a monomer, a small molecule that binds with others like it to form the building blocks for larger structures called polymers that were similar to the polymer found in the most commonly used plastic. After testing a dozen catalysts, they found one that, when added to their monomer and shown visible light, resulted in a semicrystalline polymer similar to those found in existing synthetic rubber. A harder and more rigid material was formed in the areas the light touched, while the unlit areas remained soft and stretchy. Because the substance is made of one material with different properties, it was stronger and could be stretched farther than most mixed materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This reaction takes place at room temperature, the monomer and catalyst are commercially available, and the researchers used blue LEDs as the light source in the experiment. The reaction also takes less than an hour and minimises use of any hazardous waste, which helps to make the process rapid, inexpensive, energy efficient and environmentally benign. The researchers aim to develop more objects with the material, to continue to test its usability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The material could potentially be used as a flexible foundation to anchor electronic components in medical devices or wearable tech. In robotics, strong and flexible materials are desirable to improve movement and durability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are looking forward to exploring methods of applying this chemistry towards making 3D objects containing both hard and soft components,” said first author Adrian Rylski, a doctoral student at UT Austin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by the National Science Foundation, the US Department of Energy and the Robert A. Welch Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cleverscope CS548 isolated channel oscilloscope</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The CS548 is a 2 kV DC isolated channel oscilloscope that is designed to be useful anywhere isolation and high CMRR are needed — in particular, power electronics. Measurements can be made on gate drives slewing at 100 kV/µs to check gate drive details. Using the CS1200 IsoPod, users can get &amp;lt;30 kV isolation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CS548 supports — via the Cscope4 application — frequency response analysis (using the built-in isolated signal generator), protocol decoding, maths, streaming, Excel and Matlab connectivity, spectrum analysis, mixed signal triggering and display. Each channel is isolated from the other, and ground, to 2 kV working voltage. The common mode rejection ratio is &amp;gt;100 dB at 50 MHz. Cleverscope uses 14-bit ADCs at 500 MSPS to provide a good dynamic range, with a noise floor below 100 dBV. At 10 MHz, Sinad is &amp;gt;60 dB, THD&amp;lt;-76 dBc and HD2+3&amp;lt;-80 dBc. Phase variation between channels is better than ±160ps (on the same range).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the isolated oscilloscope users can view the high side gate drive in a power switch as it is switching. Cleverscope’s CS1090 is designed to show this with FET switches that switch between 0 and 500 V in about 10 ns. The high side gate drive is therefore slewing at 50 kV/µs. Using the Cleverscope4 application, users can measure four channels (with one CS448) or eight channels (with two CS448’s trigger and clock linked) of isolated signals. This is the measured result from the CS1090 HV bridge. Dead time is about 1.077 µs (Markers 1-2). Zooming in enables users to look at the transition itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The isolated channel oscilloscope is made for measurements in power electronics systems, including on the high side. It can be used to make measurements of all high-side nodes, do EMC measurements, check out startup behaviour, calculate power loss and switching energy, and examine message contents. It is part of a tool set that is designed to do all the things needed to verify power electronics design and then test it — as a prototype or in production.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Electrode material used to enhance all-solid-state sodium batteries</title>
      &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="https://d1v1e13ebw3o15.cloudfront.net/data/80029/pool_and_spa_logo/..jpg"&gt; &lt;p&gt;A research group led by Associate Professor Atsushi Sakuda, President Masahiro Tatsumisago, and Professor Akitoshi Hayashi at &lt;a href="https://www.upc-osaka.ac.jp/new-univ/en-research/" target="_blank"&gt;Osaka Metropolitan University&lt;/a&gt; have developed a new positive electrode made of Na2FeS2 for all-solid-state sodium batteries. The batteries have a high energy storage capacity and high reversibility, and use inexpensive elements that are readily available. The researchers published their findings in the journal &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smll.202203383" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Small&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The batteries using the Na2FeS2 as a positive electrode can be charged and discharged for more than 300 cycles, due to the unique crystal structure of the Na2FeS2 that gives the electrode a long lifespan. Most high-capacity metal sulfide electrodes rely on conversion-type reactions, during which large rearrangements — during charging and discharging — are associated with inhomogeneous reactions and degradation. The Na2FeS2, on the other hand, achieves a high degree of reversibility during charging and discharging, by undergoing insertion-type reactions, which allow the electrode to retain its crystal structure over many cycles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sodium-ion batteries — which have a resource advantage over lithium-ion batteries — are attracting attention as cheaper, high-performance materials continue to be developed. “The new Na2FeS2 positive electrodes are well balanced in terms of materials, cost and lifetime; we expect them to be put to practical use in all-solid-state sodium batteries. In the future, we will continue our research to develop cheaper all-solid-state sodium batteries with even higher performance, by examining high input and output for rapid recharging, as well as making and testing of superior anode materials,” Sakuda said.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MXene composite used to reduce electromagnetic interference</title>
      &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="https://d1v1e13ebw3o15.cloudfront.net/data/80029/pool_and_spa_logo/..jpg"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Science researchers from Drexel University’s College of Engineering have developed a special coating that could one day prevent electronic devices and components from going haywire when they are too close to one another. The coating was developed using a type of two-dimensional material called MXene and is capable of absorbing and disbursing the electromagnetic fields that are the source of the problem. Buzzing, feedback or static are the noticeable manifestations of electromagnetic interference, a collision of the electromagnetic fields generated by electronics devices. Aside from the sounds, this phenomenon can also diminish the performance of the devices and lead to overheating and malfunctions if left unchecked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While researchers and technologists have reduced this problem with each generation of devices, their strategies usually involve encasing vital components with a shielding that deflects electromagnetic waves. However, according to the team of researchers from Drexel, this is not a sustainable solution. “Because the number of electronics devices will continue to grow, deflecting the electromagnetic waves they produce is really just a short-term solution. To truly solve this problem, we need to develop materials that will absorb and dissipate the interference. We believe we have found just such a material,” said Yury Gogotsi, PhD, Distinguished University and Bach Professor in the College of Engineering, who led the research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the recent edition of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666386422003678" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cell Reports Physical Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Gogotsi’s team reported that combining MXene, a material they discovered more than a decade ago, with a conductive element called vanadium in a polymer solution produces a coating that can absorb electromagnetic waves. While researchers have previously demonstrated that MXenes are effective at warding off electromagnetic interference by reflecting it, adding vanadium carbide in a polymer matrix enhances two key characteristics of the material that improve its shielding performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding vanadium to the MXene structure — a material known for its durability and corrosion-resistant properties, that is used in steel alloys for space vehicles and nuclear reactors — causes layers of the MXene to form in a sort of electrochemical grid that is suitable for trapping ions. Using microwave-transparent polymer also makes the material more permeable to the electromagnetic waves. Combined, these properties produce a coating that can absorb, entrap and dissipate the energy of electromagnetic waves at greater than 90% efficiency, according to the research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meikang Han, PhD, participated in the research and said that combining polyurethane, a common polymer used in wall paint, with a small amount of MXene filler — about one part MXene in 50 parts polyurethane — can absorb more than 90% of incident electromagnetic waves covering the entire band of radar frequencies, known as X-band frequencies. “Radio waves just disappear inside the MXene-polymer composite film — of course, nothing disappears completely, the energy of the waves is transformed to a very small amount of heat which is easily dissipated by the material,” Han said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A thin coating of the vanadium-based MXene material — less than the width of a human hair — could render a material impermeable to any electromagnetic waves in the X-band spectrum, which includes microwave radiation and is the most common frequency produced by devices. Gogotsi said that this development could be important for applications in medical and military settings where maintaining technological performance is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="img-responsive" src="https://d2emomln4apc0h.cloudfront.net/assets/489575/web_image_article/Drexel_1-s2.0-S2666386422003678-fx1_lrg.jpg" style="display: block; height: 400px; margin: auto; width: 400px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our results show that vanadium-based MXenes could play a key role in the expansion of Internet of Things technology and 5G and 6G communications. This study provides a new director for the development of thin, highly absorbent, MXene-based electromagnetic interference protection materials,” Gogotsi said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research was supported by the US National Science Foundation, the Murata Manufacturing Company and the US Department of Energy.&lt;/p&gt;
